# .dotfiles
This is a repo of configuration files and scripts for the systems and utilities that I use.  
Note that the vast majority of content here is specific to myself and my use cases, it is not intended to be a general solution for everyone. That being said, contributions and suggestions are greatly appreciated, especially for any automation scripts.

## Layout
- Any configuration files in the root of this repo are intended to never change between different systems.
- Any directory not preceeded by a `.` represents a system's name and its particular configuration.
- .default: a base directory containing a standard configuration for Arch Linux that is mostly functional by default.
- .hardware: a collection scripts, configuration, drivers, etc that is used for hardware devices that do not change between different systems that they are plugged into.
- .scripts: a collection of general useful scripts.
- .archlinux: scripts and files used to provision a new Arch Linux installation.
